    "# Tips and tricks for coding with CoPilot\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI can be a massive help when coding - if used correctly. CoPilot, chatGPT and others are \"Large Language Models\" (LLM), which basically have the ability to ingest vast amounts of text and generate statistical relations between words. *In simple terms, an LLM ingest all the language content available to it (in the internet), and predict what word is more likely to follow another*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you are familiar with the [Infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#:~:text=The%20infinite%20monkey%20theorem%20states,complete%20works%20of%20William%20Shakespeare.): given enough time, a monkey hitting keys at random on a type writter will eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare. LLMs are essentially a highly-intuitive version of that monkey, so it is very likely to produce the complete works (plus minus some errors) immediately, rather than in a time that tends to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This goes to saying that CoPilot answers must always be taken with a grain of salt and not as an absolute truth**. In order to maximise the benefits you can obtain from its answers, remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Context matters\n",
    "Give a bit of background information on what you are doing. You can start by saying \"I'm doing an assignment for a university oceanography course, and I need to use python to analyse a dataset and produce a figure\". Or something like that. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Be specific\n",
    "The more information you give CoPilot, the better. Remember it is basically a statistical relationship between words, so feed it words! Don't ask *\"How can I plot temperature?\"*, expand: *\"I am working with python and I have a netCDF with ocean surface temperature. I'd like to plot a global map of the time mean. How can I do that?\"* Doing this will improve the quality of the answer you get. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Focus on outcomes\n",
    "Be clear on what you expect to obtain from CoPilot. For this course it is mostly going to be lines of code, and you'll probably want them commented so you understand what each piece does. Ask for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Refine and iterate\n",
    "As your requests get more complex, it is likely that you won't get the correct answer immediately. You will have to tweak your requests and refine them based on what you obtained initially until you get the answer you think is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Judge\n",
    "Remember that you are the expert, you are able to understand concepts. CoPilot just generates statistically sensible answers. Do check whether the answers make sense or are just gibberish. Sometimes you will need to restart the conversations because you have entered an infinite loop of *Yes, you are correct, my previous answer was wrong and I apologise for the confusion. Here is another wrong answer\" from which CoPilot can not escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Ask CoPilot how to use CoPilot\n",
    "If you are brave enough."
