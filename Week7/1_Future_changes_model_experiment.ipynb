    "One of the wonderful, fun things that numerical models can be used for is to run experiments - in analogy to a lab experiment, a numerical experiment allows us to vary the model's conditions and study the impacts of such variation. Particularly, model's are widely used to study projected changes associated to different pathways of CO $_2$ emissions, the most well known of them being model's part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) that inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. CMIP models have a coupled atmosphere, ocean and sea ice, making them quite expensive to run and producing very large outputs - which is why their resolution is not very high and there is a spectrum of processes they don't represent, particularly the introduction of freshwater into the ocean from melting ice sheets. \n",
    "\n",
    "A way to expand on the collective effort of CMIP is to use the atmospheric output from their projections to force a model like ACCESS-OM2 that has a higher resolution at the expense of not having an atmosphere. This week we are going to use one of those experiments that uses the CMIP6 projections for the SSP585 pathway, used in the work of [Dawson et al. 2024](). The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are different possible pathways of emissions (you can see them on the figure on the right), that range from a future in which decide to actively remove anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere (the blue lines) to futures in which we continue with \"business-as-usual\" emissions, no reductions (the red lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using model simulations from the work of [Dawson et al. (2024)](). These simulations use the atmosphere from CMIP6 models at the end of the century, for the SSP585 scenario, to force ACCESS-OM2 at it's highest resolution, 0.1 $^{\\circ}$. The authors also include a simulation with projected changes to freshwater input from the melting Antarctic ice sheet, obtained from [Golledge et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0889-9)."

    "In the past week we have worked with output from ACCESS-OM2 at it's lowest resolution (1 $^{\\circ}$), from what we call an Interanually Forced simulation - which basically means we are forcing the model with a complete, interannually varying atmosphere from 1958 to 2018. This means we have the full spectrum of atmospheric variability in the forcing, which makes isolating the effect of a single component, like looking just at the effect of temperature or just at the effect of westerly winds, almost impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler way of isolating cause and effect is to use a simulation that is run with just one year of atmospheric forcing, cycling it continuously in what is called a Repeat Year Forcing simulation. The year is chosen for being a vainilla year, with nothing especially out of the ordinary happen. We will call these our **CONTROL** simulation, and it will constitute our reference point. \n",

    "2. Wind + thermal + precipitation + meltwater: in addition to the above, changes to ice sheet melt and freshwater input into the ocean were included.\n",
