    "\n",
    "The Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) is a quasi-circumpolar current that flows around Antarctica in an anti-clockwise direction. We say it is quasi-circumpolar because it is either absent or very weak in West Antarctica. It is a really important dynamical feature of the ocean circulation, because typically when there is a strong, established current, the exchange of water masses from either side becomes inhibited - in other words, the ASC acts as a barrier for open-ocean water masses to come onto the shelf. Remember that open-ocean water masses are usually warmer than the waters on shelf, and so this mediating role controls to a certain extant how much heat gets to the ice shelves. The lack (or weakness) of the ASC in West Antarctica is one of the reasons behind the vulnerability of this area and the increased melt rates observed here. \n",

    "The ASC's properties vary around the Antarctic margins, and it is usually classified into three distinct regimes: a surface intensified, a bottom intensified, and a reverse ASC.
