    "\n",
    "The loss of ice from the Antarctic Ice Sheet makes a substantial contribution to sea level rise. At present, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has been loosing mass in a way the East Antarctic has not (take a look at the figure on the right from [Smith et al. 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5845)). This mass loss is in part due to the melting of the ice shelves from below by a warmer ocean. The higher vulnerability of WAIS to melt has been linked to the particular configuration of the continental shelf and the ocean circulation : here, Circumpolar Deep Water is able to intrude onto the continental shelf and access the ice shelf cavities. \n",

    "Use the temperature and salinity fields from the ACCESS-OM2 model to compare the temperature and salinity of the continental shelf at West Antarctica vs the one at East Antarctica. The file `data/access_om2_temp_salt_avg_2000-2018.nc` contains these variables averaged over the 2000-2018 period.

    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to be able to select the continental shelf in West Antarctica and East Antarctica. Selecting the continental shelf is slightly more nuanced than just selecting a latitude/longitude box. Take inspiration from the second class, where we looked the Antarctic Bottom Water layer selecting those densities larger than 28.27 $kg/m^3$: if the continental shelf is defined as the area shallower than 1000m, you can use the `xarray.where()` function to select the continental shelf. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "xr.where(ht<1000, temp, np.nan)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where we are keeping temperature values where the depth `ht` is less than a 1000, otherwise we write `NaN`s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing the above, you will want to have pre-selected a `temp_WA` variable for the West Antarctic region, and a `temp_EA` for the East Antarctic region. Look at the figure from Smith et al. 2020 to do the selection!"

    "## Three different shelf and Antarctic Slope Current regimes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) is a quasi-circumpolar current that flows around Antarctica in an anti-clockwise direction. We say it is quasi-circumpolar because it is either absent or very weak in West Antarctica. It is a really important dynamical feature of the ocean circulation, because typically when there is a strong, established current, the exchange of water masses from either side becomes inhibited - in other words, the ASC acts as a barrier for open-ocean water masses to come onto the shelf. Remember that open-ocean water masses are usually warmer than the waters on shelf, and so this mediating role controls to a certain extant how much heat gets to the ice shelves. The lack (or weakness) of the ASC in West Antarctica is one of the reasons behind the vulnerability of this area and the increased melt rates observed here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ASC's properties vary around the Antarctic margins, and it is usually classified into three distinct regimes: a surface intensified, a bottom intensified, and a reverse ASC, each associated to different T/S shelf structures. The different regimes are illustrated in the figure below from [Huneke et al. (2022)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/52/3/JPO-D-21-0143.1.xml):\n",

    "\n",
    "An oceanographic front is a sharp boundary that separates two areas with water masses of different characteristics. Fronts are a really important feature of the ocean circulation: they sustain strong currents, they give rise to instabilities and eddies and they are usually biologically productive regions, rich in nutrients (see the figure on the left from [Chapman et al. (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0705-4). These fronts also exhert an obstacle (a barrier) for tracers to move from one side to the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Southern Ocean there are several of these fronts. Three of the most important ones are the Subantarctic Front, the Polar Front and the Southern ACC Front. Traditionally, these have been identified from sea surface height data, using a specific value of an SSH contour associated to each front. However, for some applications, like looking at changes in frontal position throughout time, instead of choosing a fixed value, another definition may be used based on the *gradient* of sea level. Essentially identifying a front as a region of *large change in small distances* rather than a fixed value. Remember that, like we saw in `2_SO_circulation_from_geostrophy.ipynb`, regions with large gradients are associated to strong currents!\n",

Use temperature, salinity and oxygen in `data/access_om2_o2_avg_2000-2018.nc` to look at the subsurface beneath those front definitions. You can find the data in  `data/access_om2_sea_level_avg_2000-2018.nc` and `data/access_om2_temp_salt_avg_2000-2018.nc`. Potential ideas for your figures are:\n",

Usually, an evaluation involves comparing the model against observations and quantifying the differences. An evaluation includes, but is not limited to:\n",

    "## Seasonality of the surface layer and open ocean polynyas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in previous classes how the formation of bottom waters (termed Antarctic Bottom Water) occurs in localised regions around the Antarctic margins. The complexity of the processes involved means that it is a process that few numerical models are able to reproduce accurately: most models produce bottom waters by open-ocean convection, large factories of bottom waters off-shelf in the Weddell and Ross Seas. Open-ocean convection is a phenomena that has rarely been observed: in fact, we have only observed it twice, in the event of the [Maud Rise polynya](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145069/deciphering-the-maud-rise-polynya) that opened up in the 1970s and in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the unique and valuable features of ACCESS-OM2 at its highest, 0.1 $^{\\circ}$ resolution, is that it does not have these polynyas and forms bottom waters on shelf, in the observed locations and in right amounts. The two lower resolutions, 0.25 $^{\\circ}$ and  1 $^{\\circ}$ (the latter is the one we will use here), do have spurious open ocean convection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the temperature, salinity, mixed layer depth and sea ice concentration seasonal cycle. See if you can identify these open ocean polynyas by looking at the mixed layer depth - remembering that the convection in these polynyas will appear as an abnormally large mixed layer depth. How does the sesasonal cycle in areas of with open ocean convection, and areas with no open ocean convection, differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try plotting mixed layer depth for each month to identify areas with convection. Once you've identified them, calculate temperature, salinity and sea ice concentration averages. How are these related? Since you have 3D temperature and salinity fields, you can either try doing a Hovmoller plot (like in `1.Introduction_to_EN422.ipynb`, or just pick a depth of your choice and plot a time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables you will need are in `data/access-om2_temp_salt_mld_clim_2000-2018.nc` (where you have `temp`, `salt` and `mld` or mixed layer depth) and `data/access-om2_sea_ice_cc_clim_2000-2018.nc` (where you have `aice_m` or sea ice concentration)."
