    "Now that we have done a little overview of ACCESS-OM2 and some of its data, it's time to do a bit of exploring into this model output. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, you can find in the `data/` directory, output for the Southern Ocean that includes temperature and salinity fields, sea surface height, and surface currents. All this variables come in monthly averages, from 1980 to 2018. We have also included a bit of information on the ocean's grid and bathymetry in the `grid.nc` file. \n",

    "Use the notebooks and code from the last four classes, as well as [CoPilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) to select a region of the Southern Ocean and investigate some aspect of the ocean state/circulation. You are welcome to choose your own path, but you can also choose from any of the subsequent \"mini\" research projects."

The higher vulnerability of WAIS to melt has been linked to warmer ocean temperatures at the continental shelf related to intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water from the open ocean.\n",

    "In order to do this, you will have to be able to select the continental shelf in a region, which is slightly more nuanced than just selecting a latitude/longitude box. Take inspiration from the second class, where we looked the Antarctic Bottom Water layer selecting those densities larger than 28.27 kg/m$^3$: if the continental shelf is defined as the area shallower than 1000m, you can use the `xarray.where()` function to select the continental shelf.
